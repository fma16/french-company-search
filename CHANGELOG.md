## [1.2.1] - {PR_MERGE_DATE}

### Changed
- Updated the Raycast SDK requirement to `@raycast/api` 1.104.16 or newer for Raycast 2 compatibility.
- Aligned Node and React types with the SDK and moved CI jobs to Node.js 22.22.2.
- Updated dependencies through Dependabot and npm audit maintenance.

### Fixed
- The template editor now identifies unsupported placeholders before saving, and generated output warns when a template contains them.
- Clipboard autofill no longer replaces a SIREN or SIRET already entered by the user.
- Unavailable Pappers identifiers now use the standard failure toast.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- **🌍 Dual-language output**: `CompanyDetailsView` now renders French and English markdown side by side with dedicated copy actions.
- **🧰 Template editor view**: New in-app editor (⌘⇧E) lists available placeholders and lets you adjust the output template before generating results.
- **🔗 Pappers shortcut**: Quick action (⌘⇧O) opens the company's Pappers page, with graceful fallback to a toast when identifiers are missing.

### Changed
- **📋 Clipboard bootstrap**: Search form can auto-fill the input from the clipboard on launch, gated by the new `autoReadClipboard` preference.
- **🗂️ Placeholder catalog**: `AVAILABLE_TEMPLATE_VARIABLES` reorganized to surface corporate vs individual variables clearly in the editor.
- **🧼 Console hygiene**: All Raycast console output now strips ANSI escape sequences to keep logs readable.

### Fixed
- **✅ Raycast validation**: Manifest updates satisfy the latest `ray lint` checks (preference type adjustment, regenerated types).
- **🧱 Type safety**: Tightened `usePromise` usage and test fixtures to keep `tsc --noEmit` green.
- **🧾 Locale formatting**: English role label overrides refined so dual-language exports stay accurate.
